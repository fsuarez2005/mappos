# Map-based Point of Sale

**mappos** is a map-oriented point-of-sale system. It's purpose is to reflect what is going on in store and present a more intuitive interface. Everything in store is visualized as a virtual object
on-screen.

## Introduction 

After being in retail for 10+ years, several features of point-of-sale systems bother me, one of which is design over function. Most of the Windows-based POS systems market to consumers via graphics. Though I have no qualms about this, it ties up development time from other features.

## Concepts

* Map-oriented. Reflect a stores floorplan without having to create a full 3D environment.
* Stable. POS systems should work like calculators with added rules. Crashing should be impossible.
* Helpful. Let employees do what they do best.
* Modular hardware and software.
  - Can be expanded.
  - Technicians can add or remove pieces freely.
  - Can still run at base level.

## Wanted Features

There are certain features that I would love in a retail system.

* Searchable list of products.
* Product knowledgebase, including employee submitted information.

## License

Unsure.
