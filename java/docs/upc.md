# UPC

The chosen symbology has bars (or spaces) of exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 
units wide each; each decimal digit to be encoded consists of two 
bars and two spaces chosen to have a total width of 7 units, in both 
an "even" and an "odd" parity form, which enables being scanned in 
either direction. Special "guard patterns" (3 or 5 units wide, not 
encoding a digit) are intermixed to help decoding.
